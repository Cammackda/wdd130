<p>Hi! My name is Johnny Cammack and my major currently is Computer Information Technology. I've been at Byu - Idaho for almost 2 semesters. I'm hopinng to graduate with a minor in music as well. I've always been involved with music and recently became interested in coding so it makes sense they should go together.</p>
<p>A bit more about myself is that I was assigned to serve a mission in the Spain Barcelona Mission, but was reassigned due to COVID to the Texas Houston South Mission where I served both years spanish speaking to a wide range of people from all places.</p>
