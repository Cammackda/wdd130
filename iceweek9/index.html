                <p>In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity. I'm not inclined to resign to maturity. If it's all right. Then it's all wrong; why bounce around to the same old song. You'd rather run when you can crawl. I know you know: that I'm not telling the truth. I know you know, you just don't have any proof. live our deceptions; learn how to bend. Your worst inhibitions tend to Psych you out in the end.</p>
