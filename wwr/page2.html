                <h2>What are the rivers made of?</h2>
                <p>The rivers are indeed actually made of water! Water is the combination of the elements Hydrogen and
                    Oxygen! or H2O. One hydrogen atom and two Oxygen atoms. Commonly referred to as the "Mickey Mouse"
                    element.</p>
                <h2>How are the rivers shaped?</h2>
                <p>The rivers are shaped like snakes because of the winding pattern made by the water as is wears away
                    at the river banks. This makes for a delightful banter of raft and river.</p>
                <h2>What is a raft?</h2>
                <p>A raft is something that makes you float! Well... not just you but your friends as well! You can enjoy
                    a group of 4-6 people in one raft! Smaller rafts move quicker, while the bigger rafts are safer.
                    It's up to you to decide how you enjoy the river!</p>
                <h2>Can you swim?</h2>
                <p>I really hope so! Because you will need to be able to! River guides will come around to knock your
                    rafts in the water so watch out! Be prepared to throw extra oars in your raft at them!</p>
